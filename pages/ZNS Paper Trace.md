		- Zone Append
			- Append data to a zone without defining offset
			- Drive returns where data was written in the zone
		- Existing ZAC/ZBC-aware file systems "just work" to ZNS
		- Support storage stack
			- User-space libraries
				- Libzbd
				- Nvme-cli
				- Blktests
				- Util-linux(blkzone)
				- fio
				- libzns
			- Kernel-space libraries
				- NVMe support for Zones

	- Zone Append: A New Way of Writing to Zoned Storage (WD'2020)
		- https://www.usenix.org/system/files/vault20_slides_bjorling.pdf
		- One writer per zone -> Good performance
		- Multiple writers per zone -> Lock contention
			- Performance could improve by writing multiple zones
				- But performance is limited
					- Reason?  N * qd ?
			- Zone Append for rescue
				- APIs see slides
				- Use-cases
					- RocksDB + ZNS
					- ZNS + Append + SWAP
					- Uncoordinated writes to Zones for distributed Storage

	  collapsed:: true
		- Keywords: PLP, SSD Buffer Reduction
		- **Background & Motivation**
			- ZNS are useful in multi-tenant system
			- ZNS SSD need a much larger write buffer than legacy SSDs (Questionable)
				- support many I/O stream
					- each stream require its own buffer space for write buffering
						- Larger SSD buffer
							- More Capacitors for Power-Loss Protection (PLP) for Durability
								- More internal space consumption and cost
		- **Design**
			- Ensure durability for WAL or journal only
				- Reduce the size of buffer
			- Balanced flush to zones to reduce as parallel as possible
				- Avoid PLP flush to the same plane (Questionable)
					- Reduce PLP time
		- **Evaluated by FEMU and RocksDB**
		- **Concern**
			- ZNS tends to use less DRAM than legacy SSD
			- The hidden assumption of design 2 is single zone data would gather in the same plane
				- A single zone should span over the parallel unit, which is already balanced
