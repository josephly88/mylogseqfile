* *Taylor Series* is a way to approximate a function ~f(x)~ at ~a~ using the following series

* When $a = 0$, the series is called *Maclaurin Series*
*
* Example: Find the Maclaurin Series of $f(x) = e^x$
** $f(0) = e^0 = 1$
** $\frac{f'(0)}{1!}x = e^0x = x$
** $\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 = \frac{e^0}{2!}x^2 = \frac{x^2}{2!}$
** $\frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 = \frac{e^0}{3!}x^3 = \frac{x^3}{3!}$
** Hence, we conclude that $e^x =$
