- ## Background
	- Response to [[Russell's Paradox]] and other issues with earlier set theories
	- Build the axioms that define the basic properties of sets
- ## The Zermelo-Fraenkel Axiom
	- ### Axiom of Extensionality
		- Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements
	- ### Axiom of Pairing
		- For any two sets x and y, there exists a set that contains exactly x and y as elements
			- Example
				- If Set A and Set B exist
				- Then, Set C = {Set A, Set B} exists
	- ### Axiom of Union
		- For any set x, there exists a set that contains all the elements of the sets that are members of x
			- Example
				- A = {1, 2}, B = {3, 4}
				- X = {A, B} (By Axiom of Pairing)
				- Then a new set U would contains all the members of A and B
				- U = {1, 2, 3, 4} exists
	- ### Axiom of Power Set
		- For any set x, there exists a set that contains all the subsets of x
			- Example
				- A = {1, 2, 3}
				- P = {âˆ…, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}
	- ### Axiom of Regularity
		- For any set x, there exists a set that
	- ### Axiom of Infinity
		- There exists an infinite set
	- ### Axiom of Choice
		-
