- ## Idea
	- The performance of parallel systems can be greatly increased by scaling the problem size to match the number of processors

	- Address the limitation of Amdahl's Law
		- Amdahl's Law assumed that
			- The problem size is fixed
			- Parallelism can only improve performance up to a certain point
	- Observation
		- Many real-world problems have large amounts of parallelism that can be effectively exploited by parallel systems
			- Scaling the problem size, such as
				- Increase the number of data points being analyzed
				- Analyzing more complex systems
				- Increase the number of nodes and volume of traffic
				- Increasing the number of concurrent users and volume of data being processed
