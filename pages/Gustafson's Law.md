- ## Idea
	- The performance of parallel systems can be greatly increased by scaling the problem size to match the number of processors
	- Address the limitation of Amdahl's Law
		- Assumed that
			- The problem size is fixed
			- Parallelism can only improve performance up to a certain point
	- Observation
		- Many real-world problems have large amounts of parallelism that can be effectively exploited by parallel systems
