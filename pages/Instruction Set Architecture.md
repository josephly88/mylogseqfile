  id:: 128abdf3-0739-4576-a667-2d718e605b87
- Defines:
	- Machine Language
	- Format of Instruction
	- Number of Register
	- [[Memory Address Mode]]
	- Data Type for Instruction
	- Standard Interface between software and hardware
- ## User-visible ISA vs. Implementation-specific ISA
	- ### User-visible ISA
		- Part of the ISA visible to software (compiler or programmer)
		- Communicate with
			- Processor
			- Registers
			- Memory address modes
	- ### Implementation-specific ISA
		- Details of the microarchitecture
			- Pipeline depth
			- Cache size
			- Instruction execution times
	- Same user-visible ISA could have different implementation-specific ISA
