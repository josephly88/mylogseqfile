** Super Device (SD): Namespaces??
** Super Block (SB): A set of blocks across each die of an SSD
*** This organization is for high write performance
*
* Balancing between SDs
** Reason:
*** Assume each SD have a write performance 1000 Mbps
**** In total: 2000 Mbps
*** If one SD is no longer be written
**** Amount of free space decreasing below a critical threshold
*** The resultant performance become: 1000 Mbps
*** Hence, must balance zones across one or more SDs in a ZNS SSD
