* *Questions*
** How do host handle GC without affecting the performance?
** Is ZNS only suitable for sequential workload, such as LSM-Tree, F2FS?
** Open Zone vs. Active Zone? What device resource constraint the number of Open Zone and Active Zone?
*
* *3 Evolving towards ZNS*
** *3.1 Hardware Impact*
*** *Zone Sizing*
**** Zone Capacity = N * Flash Block
***** Stripe across multiple flash dies
****** High read/write speed
****** Protect die level failure by per-stripe parity
***** Common practice 16-128 blocks across dies
****** Hundreds of MB - X GB (Single digit)
**** Large Zone
***** (+) Better Performance
***** (-) Host lose the data placement freedom
**** Small Zone (Prefer)
***** (+) Host has more data placement freedom
***** (-) Worse Performance
****** Unless increase the host complexity, such as host-side parity, deeper I/O queue depth
***** If no stripe-wide parity --> Even smaller zone size could achieve
*** *Device Resources*
**** Number of active zone constraint
***** Around 8-32
***** Due to the hardware resource
****** XOR engines, memory (SRAM and DRAM), power capacity
****** Data and parity could occupy hundreds of KB to MB
******* Due to two-step programming
***** Increase the number of active zone by
****** Extra power capacitors
****** DRAM for data movement
****** Reduce parity requirement
****** Write-back Cache (e.g., SLC)
** *3.2 Host Software Adoption*
*** *Host-side FTL (HFTL)*
**** Responsibility
***** Translation Mapping
***** Garbage Collection
**** Should not affect the host applications
* *4 Implementation*
** *4.1 General Linux Support*
*** Linux kernel's Zoned Block Device (ZBD) subsystem
**** Unified zoned storage API
***** In-kernel API
***** An ioctl-based userspace API
*** *fio*
**** Use Userspace API
**** Modification
***** Avoid I/O beyond zone capacity
**** Not modified
***** No active zone limit tracking
*** *Zone Capacity*
**** Kernel maintain an in-memory zone descriptors
*** Evaluated ZNS SSD
**** Expose a fraction of conventional block device
**** ZNS
* *5 Evaluation*
** *Device*
*** Max Active Zones: 14
*** Zone Size: 2048 MB
*** Zone Capacity: 1077MB
** *5.1 Raw I/O Characteristics*
*** Zone Seq Write Throughput
**** 7%OP: 370MB/s
**** 28%OP: 590MB/s
**** ZNS: 1010MB/s
***** 1.7 - 2.7X higher
*** Read Latency
**** Write and Random read simutaneously
**** Latency increase linearly with the write target
*** Reason
**** Align writes onto distinct erase blocks
**** Avoid GC
***** No host data movement is accounted?
***** Any extra care for data with similar lifetime?
