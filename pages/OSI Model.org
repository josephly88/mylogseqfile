* The Open Systems Interconnection model
** *Level 7 - Application Layer*
*** Focus on application specific protocols and interfaces
*** Functions
**** Network Virtual Terminal
**** FTAM-File transfer access and management
**** Mail Services
**** Directory Services
*** HTTP, FTP, SMTP
** *Level 6 - Presentation Layer*
*** Or called Translation Layer
*** Focus on data formatting and conversion
*** Functions
**** Translation
**** Encryption/ Decryption
**** Compression
** *Level 5 - Session Layer*
*** Focus on managing session between applications
:PROPERTIES:

**** Session
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true

***** Allows apps to exchange data and state information
***** Across multiple requests and connections
***** Example
****** User login state
****** Shopping cart state
****** Conversation
*** Functions
**** Session establishment, maintenance, and termination
**** Synchronization
**** Dialog Controller
** *Level 4 - Transport Layer*
*** Focus on transporting data between processes running on hosts
*** Part of the OS
*** Functions
**** Segmentation and Reassembly
***** Data from the session layer ==> Segments (Smaller Unit)
***** Reform data from the segments from the network layer
**** Service Point Addressing
***** Deliver to the correct process
**** Error Detection and Control
***** CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
***** Checksum
*** TCP and UDP
**** Port number
***** 80 is the default web application port
**** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
***** Connection-oriented and reliable
****** The receiver always sends an ACK
****** Larger error correction and flow control
**** UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
***** Connectionless and unreliable
****** No ACK
****** No time is wasted
** *Level 3 - Network Layer*
*** Focus on routing packets between networks
*** Functions
**** Routing
*** IP Address
**** Logical Address
**** Network Address vs. Host Address
***** Example: 192.168.1.5
****** If 255.255.255.0 is the Subnet Mask Value
******* Then 192.168.1.0 is the Network Address
******* And 0.0.0.5 is the Host Address
** *Level 2 - Data Link Layer*
*** Focus on the same network segment
**** Without going to another router
**** Example: Same WiFi access point
*** Functions
**** Error detection
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true

***** Not correction
**** Framing
:PROPERTIES:

***** Header
***** Packet (Data)
***** Trailer
**** Flow Control
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
***** Amount of data can be sent before receiving an acknowledgement
**** Access control
*** MAC Address
**** Media Access Control
**** Hardware address
***** Network interface card (NIC)
****** Assigned by the manufacturer
**** Globally unique
**** 48 bits
***** ~300 Trillion >> 8 Billion People in the world
** *Level 1 - Physical Layer*
*** Focus on physical connection
**** Through cable or electrical signal
*** Transmission of raw data
*** Functions
**** Bit synchronization
***** Synchronization of clock
**** Bit rate control
**** [[Physical Topologies]]
**** [[Transmission Mode]]
