process (i_data, i_enable)
begin
  if i_enable = '1' then
    o_latch <= i_data;
  end if;
end process;
#+END_SRC
** ~i_enable = '0'~ is not specified, and thus, the value does not change (Which implies a latch)

*** #+BEGIN_SRC VHDL
type STD_LOGIC_VECTOR is array (3 downto 0) of STD_LOGIC;
-- the range must be natural range (>= 0)
