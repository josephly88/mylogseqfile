** ![image](../assets/bus_1675851662441_0.jpg){:height 197, :width 289}
** Advantages
*** Cost-effective
**** Easy to build
**** Less expensive
*** For small networks
*** Very less cable
*** Easy to add nodes
*** Single failure would not affect the network
** Disadvantages
*** The whole network will fail if the cable gets faulty
*** Slow in operation
*** Limited length of cable
*** Troubleshooting is time-consuming for large network
* *Star Topology*
:PROPERTIES:

** ![image](../assets/star_1675851862954_0.png){:height 164, :width 282}
** Advantages
*** Easy to build
*** Relatively less cable
*** Easily managed the network by the central hub
*** Easy to add nodes
*** Single failure would not affect the network
*** Identifying and Troubleshooting is easier
** Disadvantages
*** The whole network will fail if the central hub is failure
*** Performance depends on the central hub
* *Ring Topology*
:PROPERTIES:

** ![image](../assets/ring_1675852271345_0.jpg){:height 160, :width 269}
** Advantages
*** Cost-effective
**** Easy to build
**** Less expensive
*** Reduce packet collision ==> Efficient for data transmission (For small ring)
*** Identifying and Troubleshooting is easier
** Disadvantages
*** The whole network will fail if one node is failure
*** Large ring slow data transmission (Shared bandwidth for all nodes)
*** Easy to overburden the network resources and capacity
*** Adding or removing a node require the entire network to be offline
* *Mesh Topology*

** ![image](../assets/mesh_1675852514592_0.jpg){:height 163, :width 277}
** Data Transmission Method
*** Routing
**** Determine the shortest path
*** Flooding
**** Sent the data to all neighbors
** Advantages
*** Most stable and reliable
**** Resist the failure
** Disadvantages
*** Labor-intensive
**** Require a lot of wire and configuration
**** Expensive
