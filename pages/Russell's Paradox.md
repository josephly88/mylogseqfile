- ## Paradox
	- Set A = { Sets : Do not contain itself }
		- Does Set A contain itself?
			- If Yes -> Set A should be removed from Set A -> No (Contradiction)
			- If No -> Set A should be included in Set A -> Yes (Contradiction)
- ## Meaning and Impact
	- If we allow unrestricted formation of sets, we can end up with sets that lead to logical contradictions
		- We cannot simply assume that all mathematical concepts can be built up from a small set of basic axioms
	- Led to Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZF)
