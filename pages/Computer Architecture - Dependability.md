- ## Metrics
	- Mean time to failure (MTTF)
		- Average time between the occurrences of a failure in a system
		- $MTTF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{\# of Failures}}$
	- Mean time to repair (MTTR)
		- Average time taken to repair a system once it has failed
		- $MTTR = \frac{\text{Total Repair Time}}{\# of Repairs}$
	- Mean time between failure (MTBF)
		- Average time between the occurrences of two consecutive failures in a system
		- $MTBF = MTTF + MTTR$
	- Availability
		- $Availability = \frac{MTTF}{MTBF + MTTR} * 100\%$
	- Summary
		- MTTF and MTBF: System Reliability
		- Availability: System's Uptime
