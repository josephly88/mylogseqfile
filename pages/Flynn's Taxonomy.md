- ## Definitions
	- Classifies computer architectures into four main categories based on the number of instruction and data streams
- ## Categories
	- ### SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)
		- PC, servers
	- ### SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)
		- Parallel processing of large amounts of data
		- Video or Audio Processing
	- ### MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data)
		- Rarely used because they are difficult to implement
	- ### MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)
		- Most complex type
		- Scientific simulations and parallel databases, distributed computing environments
