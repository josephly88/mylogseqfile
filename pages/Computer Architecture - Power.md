- ### Thermal Design Power (TDP)
	- Maximum amount of power that a component is expected to draw under normal operating conditions (W)
		- Also the maximum temperature that the component is designed to operate at
			- Higher -> Generate More Heat -> Require more cooling
- ### Dynamic Energy or Power per Transistor
	- Dynamic Power $\propto C_{L} * V^2 * TR$
		- $C_L$: Capacitive Loading
		- $V$: Voltage
		- $TR$: Toggle rate (Frequency of toggling)
	- Dynamic Energy is without $TR$
	- Indicates reducing $C_L$ or $V$ or $TR$ will result in a reduction in dynamic power per transistor
- ### Techniques for Reducing Power
	- Clock Gating
		- Selectively disabling the clock to certain parts of the circuit when they are not in use
			- Since clock signals are a major contributor to power consumption ($TL$)
	- Power Gating
		- Completely turn of part of the circuit
			- Particularly for reducing leakage power
				- Leakage Power: the power consumed even when a transistor is not switching
	- Voltage Scaling
		- Reducing the operating voltage of a circuit
	- Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
		- Adject voltage and frequency based on its workload
	- Data Compression
		- Compress before transmitted or stored to reduce power c
