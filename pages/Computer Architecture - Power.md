- ### Thermal Design Power (TDP)
	- Maximum amount of power that a component is expected to draw under normal operating conditions (W)
		- Also the maximum temperature that the component is designed to operate at
			- Higher -> Generate More Heat -> Require more cooling
- ### Dynamic Power per Transistor
	- Dynamic Power $\propto C_{L} * V^2 * TR$
		- $C_L$: Capacitive Loading
		- $V$: Voltage
		- $TR$: Toggle rate (Frequency of toggling)
	- Dynamic Energy is without $TR$
	- Indicates reducing $C_L$ or $V$ or $TR$ will result in a reduction in dynamic power per transistor
- ### Static Power
	- Or called leakage power
	- Power consumed by a circuit even when it is in a static (Non-switching)
		- Due to leakage current that flows through transistors
			- Static Power $\propto I_{static} * V_{dd}$
				- $I_{static}$: The leakage current of the transistors in the circuit
					- Scale with the num(transistor)
				- $V_{dd}$: The supply voltage of the circult
- ### Techniques for Reducing Power
	- Clock Gating
		- Selectively disabling the clock to certain parts of the circuit when they are not in use
			- Since clock signals are a major contributor to power consumption ($TL$)
	- Power Gating
		- Completely turn of part of the circuit
			- Particularly for reducing leakage power
				- Leakage Power: the power consumed even when a transistor is not switching
	- Voltage Scaling
		- Reducing the operating voltage of a circuit
	- Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
		- Adject voltage and frequency based on its workload
	- Data Compression
		- Compress before transmitted or stored to reduce power consumption
			- Although more computation are require for compression and decompression
				- Effective for transmission or storage is a major bottleneck
				  collapsed:: true
					- Wireless communication intensive
					- Embedded system with limited memory
				- Well design compression techniques to minimize
					- Computation complexity
					- Power consumption
	- Low-power Design Techniques
		- e.g.,
			- Minimize the use of power-hungry components
				- such as clock buffers
			- Reduce the number of transistor between 0 and 1
