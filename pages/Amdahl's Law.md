- ## Idea
	- The overall performance of a system is limited by the performance of its slowest component
	- Improvement to faster components will have diminishing returns if the slower component remains unchanged
- ## Definition
	- $Speedup = 1 / (( 1-P) + \frac{P}{S})$
		- $P$ : Proportion of the system that can be parallelized
		- $S$: Speedup factor that can be achieved by making the parallelized portion faster
		- Since $Time_{new} = Time_{old}
