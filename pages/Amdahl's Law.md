- ## Idea
	- The overall performance of a system is limited by the performance of its slowest component
	- Improvement to faster components will have diminishing returns if the slower component remains unchanged
- ## Definition
	- $Speedup = 1 / (( 1-P) + \frac{P}{S})$
		- $P$ : Proportion of the system that can be parallelized
		- $S$: Speedup factor that can be achieved by making the parallelized portion faster
		- Prove:
			- $Time_{new} = Time_{old} * ((1-P) + \frac{P}{S})$
			- $Speedup = Time_{old} / Time_{new}$
				- Since $Time_{old} > Time_{new}$
- ## Meaning
	- The maximum speedup is limited by the propotion $P$ of the systme that cannot be parallelized
		- $P$ closer to 1 -> Speedup is greater
