* *Interface*
** Batch Count vs. Batch Size
*** Batch Size is how many images generated in one single generation
**** Takes more VRAM if size is higher
*** Batch Count is how many generations
** Sampling Method
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
*** DIMM
**** Generally faster (see earlier thread) and cleaner overall, with nice details at low steps.
*** Euler
**** The second best (after DDIM) for speed and low step results. (repeat images from first run, with higher steps)
***
*** Except for two slower methods of DPM2 and HEUN, there's really no different as steps > 50

*** Tested by {{twitter https://twitter.com/GaffiKowatch/status/1563466824460935168}}

** CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance)
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
*** Images generated using CFG are very similar in composition and objects, but also in high quality
***
*** Range
**** Low (0-6): Free to ignore the prompt
**** Mid (6-10): Do what you're asking, but you don't mind a bit of variation
**** High (10+): Do exactly what you tell it, with no deviation
****
*** High CFG would stick to the prompt or 'img2img' more
**** If the CFG scale is too large, the quality will suffer and the image will be distorted
****
*** In many cases, we don't need to increase the CFG
**** Unless you want to generate something the dataset has not trained, or combining multiple concepts
** Denoising Strength
*** The larger the value, samples more data, takes longer to complete
**** The similarity to the original picture would be lower
*** Let the AI create or stick to the original image
***
*** Different Denoising Strength (CFG = 7)
**** 0.2-0.4: Small changes in objects
**** 0.6: Objects change
**** 0.8: Posture, background, and object change
**** 1: Completely new

*** Prompt Matrix
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
**** e.g., a busy city street in a modern city|illustration|cinematic lighting
**** A modern city with {illustration / cinematic} lighting
**** Total 4 images would be created (00, 01, 10, 11)
*** X-Y Plot
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
**** Create a multi-dimensional array of images for comparison

** CFG vs. Denoising Strength
*** DIMM (30 steps)
**** Real picture
***** Denoising
****** 0.2 : Original picture in painting
****** 0.4 : More paint less realistic
****** 0.6 : Animated original picture
****** 0.8 : Completely new picture
***** CFG
****** If CFG is too low, increasing the denoising would distort the image
****** CFG > 7 has no significant changes

**** Animated image
***** Denoising
****** 0.2 : The exact image with tiny changes
****** 0.4 - 0.6 : Mostly the original image, but with extra edition
****** 0.8 : Completely new image
***** CFG
****** If CFG is too low, increasing the denoising would distort the image
****** 7 : The middle between the new generated and the original
****** 13+ : More the CFG Template and prompts
