* Dependability
** Ability to operate correctly under a wide range of operating conditions
** Related Attributes
*** Reliability
**** Ability to perform the intended function without failure or errors over a specified period of time
*** Availability
**** Ability to be operational and accessible when needed
***** Uptime, repair time, recover form failure or error
*** Safety
**** Ability to operate without causing harm or damage
***** To people, environment, or other system
*** Security
**** Ability to protect against unauthorized access, modification, or theft of information
** Metrics
*** Mean time to failure (MTTF)
**** Average time between the occurrences of a failure in a system
**** $MTTF = \frac{\text{Total Operating Time}}{\text{\# of Failures}}$
*** Mean time to repair (MTTR)
**** Average time taken to repair a system once it has failed
**** $MTTR = \frac{\text{Total Repair Time}}{\# of Repairs}$
*** Mean time between failure (MTBF)
**** Average time between the occurrences of two consecutive failures in a system
**** $MTBF = MTTF + MTTR$
*** Availability
**** $Availability = \frac{MTTF}{MTBF + MTTR} * 100%$
