** Searching
*** Atomicity of PMR (See spec has any consistency guarantee methods)
** Editing
*** Background & Motivation
**** 由spec support 開始切入, 而不是2B-SSD切入
***** 需要dual interface, 而NVMe就有
**** Elaboration of Atomicity here, maybe definition
**** Data buffer is fault-tolerance (support)
**** Mention that OCSSD paper
***** open-channel is not applicable in conventional SSD
** Figure illustrating
