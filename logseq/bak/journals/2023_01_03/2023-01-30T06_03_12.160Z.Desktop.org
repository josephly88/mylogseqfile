** Construction of T-shirt [[Clothing - Construction]] [[未整理]]
*** There are several factors to consider when evaluating the construction of a T-shirt:
*** Seams: The seams of a T-shirt should be double-stitched for added durability. Single-stitched seams are more prone to coming undone or fraying over time.
*** Neckline: The neckline of a T-shirt should be well-constructed and should not stretch out or become distorted over time. A ribbed neckline can help to keep the neckline in shape.
*** Hem: The hem of a T-shirt should be well-constructed and should not stretch out or become distorted over time. A double-stitched hem can help to keep the hem in shape.
*** Shoulder seams: The shoulder seams of a T-shirt should be well-constructed and should not stretch out or become distorted over time. A double-stitched shoulder seam can help to keep the seam in shape.
*** Sleeves: The sleeves of a T-shirt should be well-constructed and should not stretch out or become distorted over time. A double-stitched sleeve seam can help to keep the seam in shape.
*** Overall, good construction in a T-shirt involves using high-quality materials and techniques to create a garment that is durable and well-made. By looking for T-shirts with these characteristics, you can ensure that you are getting a T-shirt that is likely to last and maintain its shape over time.
