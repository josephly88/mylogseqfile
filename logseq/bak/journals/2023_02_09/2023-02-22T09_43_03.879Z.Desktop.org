* To recompile the nvme-cli in Ubuntu if you installed it using apt install, you need to build it from source code. Here are the steps:
** Download the source code of nvme-cli from the official repository, e.g., https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli.
** Extract the downloaded source code.
** Change to the directory containing the source code using cd.
** Configure the build using ./configure. This step will check for dependencies and configure the build.
** Build the source code using make. This step will compile the source code.
** Install the compiled binary using sudo make install. This step will install the binary in the appropriate location.
** Finally, verify that the new version of nvme-cli has been installed by running nvme and checking the version.
** Note that the above steps are for building nvme-cli from source code on Ubuntu. The steps may differ for other operating systems.
