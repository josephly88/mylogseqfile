** Single Quotes treat every character as a literal
*** No single quote can be between single quotes, even with backslash (Escape Character)
** Double Quotes treat the following characters differently
*** $ ` \ ! * @
*** Backslashes is the escape character
*** Double Quotes can be within another double quote by using backslash
** Example
*** #+BEGIN_SRC bash
echo '$PATH'
# Output: $PATH
echo "$PATH"
# Output: /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:...
#+END_SRC

# Hello World
sudo cat root_file
# Hello World
#+END_SRC
