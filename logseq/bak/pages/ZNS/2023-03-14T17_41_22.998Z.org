** Block interface - One dimensional arrays (matches HDD)
** Due to the mismatch between write and erase in SSD
*** Write - Page, Erase - Block (Larger)
** FTL hides this mismatch from host (In-place update)
*** Logical-to-physical page mapping
**** DRAM capacity is expensive (High cost per GB of usable capacity)
*** Over-provisioning
**** 28% over-provisioned space is expensive (High cost per GB of usable capacity)
**** Additional mapping
*** GC
**** Throughput Limitation
**** Write-amplification
**** Performance unpredictability
**** High tail latency
** Expense
*** Over-provisioning space
*** DRAM
* *Responsibility*
** GC => Host
** Reliability => ZNS
** Media-management => ZNS
