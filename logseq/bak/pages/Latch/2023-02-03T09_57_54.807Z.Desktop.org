*** (a) and (b) are the same (Just organized in vertical to show symmetry)
** Both Q and Q' are stable, so we call that bistable
** Storing 1 bit information
** Not useful
*** Value in Q and Q' would not change

*** NOR Gate : Both (0,0) --> 1, else --> 0
*** Case 1 (0,1) and 2 (1,0)
**** Case 1
***** R is 1 --> Q = 0
****** Q and S are 0 --> Q' = 1
**** Similarly for Case 2
*** Case 3 (0,0)
**** Assume Q,Q' = (0,1)
***** Q and S are 0 --> Q' = 1
****** R is 0 and Q' is 1 --> Q = 0
***** Keeping the previous Q,Q' = (0,1)
**** Similarly for Q,Q' = (1,0)
*** Case 4 (1,1)
**** R is 1 --> Q = 0
**** S is 1 --> Q' = 0
**** No meaning
** S: Set, R: Reset
** Awkward
*** S and R are 1 are strange
