** Periodically reading data from an area of RAM and immediately rewriting it to the same area
** Reason:
*** Data is stored inside DRAM by an electrical charge in capacitors
*** The charge is only temporary, so capacitors are needed to recharge periodically.
*** Either memory controller or CPU perform this process automatically
