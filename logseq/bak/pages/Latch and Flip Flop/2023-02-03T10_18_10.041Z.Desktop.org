*** (a) and (b) are the same (Just organized in vertical to show symmetry)
** Both Q and Q' are stable, so we call that bistable
** Storing 1 bit information
** Not useful
*** Value in Q and Q' would not change
*** Since it has no input

*** NOR Gate : Both (0,0) --> 1, else --> 0
*** Case 1 (0,1) and 2 (1,0)
**** Case 1
***** R is 1 --> Q = 0
****** Q and S are 0 --> Q' = 1
**** Similarly for Case 2
*** Case 3 (0,0)
**** Assume Q,Q' = (0,1)
***** Q and S are 0 --> Q' = 1
****** R is 0 and Q' is 1 --> Q = 0
***** Keeping the previous Q,Q' = (0,1)
**** Similarly for Q,Q' = (1,0)
*** Case 4 (1,1)
**** R is 1 --> Q = 0
**** S is 1 --> Q' = 0
**** No meaning
** S: Set ==> Q = 1
** R: Reset ==> Q = 0
** Awkward
*** When S and R are 1, output is strange
*** No clock to change the signal synchronously

** Solve the problem from SR-Latch
** CLK = 0, no change
** CLK = 1, Q <-- D (Transparent)
*** Can update continuously when CLK = 1
* *D Flip-Flop*
** ![image](../assets/image_1675418947551_0.png)
** Only change the Q when clock edge
** Build by two D-Latch
** Explaination
*** When CLK = 0
**** Master CLK is 1 --> N1 = D  (Transparent)
***** Slave CLK is 0 --> Q = Q_prev
*** Only when rising edge
**** Q = N1 = D
**** Else keeping the value of Q
