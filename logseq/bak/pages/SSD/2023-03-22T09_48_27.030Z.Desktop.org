** SSD Architecture
:PROPERTIES:

*** ![image](../assets/SSD_Architecture.drawio_1678693542781_0.png)
*** Channel - Chip - Die - Plane (Access Unit) - Block (Erase Unit) - Page (Read/Write Unit)
*** LUN : Logical Unit Number
** Flash Chip Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
*** Standard
**** Read
**** Write
**** Erase
**** Status
**** ID
**** Reset
**** Enable/Disable
*** Optional
**** Copyback
***** Copy flash page within chips without off-chip data transfer
**** Partial read or write
***** Access less than a page size
** Over-Provisioning
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
*** Always keeping a portion of free blocks
**** Immediately supply free blocks
***** Reason: Erase operation takes longer than Write due to the granularity
****** Erase - Block, but Write - Page
**** Beneficial for GC, wear-leveling, and bad block management
*** OP occupies the storage space (According to Samsung)
**** e.g., 128GB SSD : 120GB (user capacity) + 8GB (OP)
**** User could increase the amount of OP
** Write Disturb
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
*** Data block write affects the nearby blocks
* *Kernel*
** Command
*** TRIM (SATA) or DEALLOCATE (NVMe)
**** Trimming means making a range of LBA as invalid
***** Inform SSD the data is no longer needed and can be erased
* *Performance Metric*
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
** Bandwidth
*** The maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a given amount of time
*** The size of a pipe
** Throughput
*** The actual amount of data that can be transferred or processed in a specific amount of time
*** Volume of the water through the pipe
** IOPS
** Latency
*
* *Protocol*
** NVMe
*** NVMe Namespace
:PROPERTIES:
:collapsed: true
:END:
**** An SSD device could separate into multiple logical storage unit to host
**** Isolation while multiple application access to the same physical device
