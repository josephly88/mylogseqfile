* Knowledge
** Zone
*** Active zone limit
**** Limit on the zone either in OPEN and CLOSED state
**** Expect to have 8-32 active zone
***** Due to
****** Programing disturbs
****** XOR engine
****** Memory resource (SRAM or DRAM)
****** Power capacitor to persist parity data following a power failure
***** Could increase by
****** Extra power capacityor
****** DRAM for data movement
****** Reduce parity requirement
****** Write-back cache (e.g., SLC)
**** SMR HDD does not have this
***** could allow all zones to stay in CLOSED
*** Impact to Existing Setup
**** SSD Hardware
***** Mapping Table
****** Block-interface: Large, fully-associative mapping
****** Zone: Coarse-grained mapping
******* Erase block level
******* Hybrid fashion
**** Host Software
***** Sequential write applications are prime candidates
*
* Question
** Difference between Zone Size and Zone Capacity
** How to utilize ZNS to achieve low write amp / high throughput?
** How does per-stripe parity work?
** DRAM buffer and Open Zone or Active Zone?
*** Can Close state been read? How does it work?
