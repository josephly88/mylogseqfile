** For example: My sixty-year-old mother-in-law did a ten-foot dive into the swimming pool and was greatly admired.
** Question: When or when not to use hyphen?
** Rule 1: The phrase with the number is before the noun
*** e.g., Two-door car
*** e.g., Eighteen-year-old students
*** e.g., He did really badly in the race and came twenty-second
out of twenty-two runners.
**** The first number is an ordinal "twenty-second", the second one is a number between 21 and 99 so it's "twenty-two"
*** Only for numbers before the noun
**** The students are eighteen years old. (NO hyphen)
** Rule 2: Number from twenty-one to ninety-nine
*** e.g., Two hundred and ninety-nine
** Rule 3: Add participles to nouns, adverbs, and adjectives to make two-word adjectives
*** e.g., Well-respected politician ('adverb + past participle' adjective before the noun)
*** Again, only for adjective comes before the noun
**** The politicians were well respected. (NO hyphen)
**** A special case would be
***** He is really easy-going ('adjective + present participle' adjective, need a hyphen)
** Rule 4: Never use hyphen in compound adjectives that have an adverb with ends in -l-y
*** A carefully written letter (NO hyphen)
** Compound nouns are mostly with no hyphen in it
