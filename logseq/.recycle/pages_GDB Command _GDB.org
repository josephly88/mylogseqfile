* *l* - list : Print 10 lines of code (Next time l would print the next 10 lines)
* *b* {line number} - breakpoint : Set a breakpoint
* *r* - run : Run the program until it meets the breakpoint
* *n* - next & *s* - step : Run one line and break again
** n : always goes to the next line, where function will be ran automatically
** s : if function call is invoked, go to the first line of the function
** Example:

swap(&a, &b);
cout << a << endl;
// n would go to line 2
// s would go into the swap() function
#+END_SRC
