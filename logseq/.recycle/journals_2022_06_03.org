** Thinking about my career path #Career
*** Should I transfer to MPhil? Or keep pursuing PhD?
**** Both require me to finish the first paper
**** PhD
***** Since my pre-candidacy exam is postponed, maybe half year, my graduation might be postponed at least half year. In total, I would be unpaid for more than a year
***** Less interested in research. Reading papers are boring to me. No idea how to come up some designs. Seems everything is done by others.
***** OpenSSD is too unstable, that I can't leave it and run for 5 hours. I need to monitor the status every 15 mins, which is terrible
***** Might have a better opportunity after graduation. But most of the jobs are not in Hong Kong.
