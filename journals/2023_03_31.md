	- Sure! Here's a possible learning agenda for digital systems: #[[Digital System]]
		- Programmable Logic Devices: Study programmable logic devices such as CPLDs and FPGAs, which can be programmed to implement digital circuits.
		- Hardware Description Languages: Learn about hardware description languages such as VHDL and Verilog, which are used to describe digital circuits at a higher level of abstraction.
		- Testing and Verification: Learn about testing and verification techniques for digital circuits, including simulation, formal verification, and testing with test vectors.
		- Advanced Topics: Depending on your interests and goals, you may want to study advanced topics such as computer architecture, digital signal processing, or embedded systems.
		  
		  Remember, this is just one possible learning agenda, and the order and emphasis of topics may vary depending on your goals and interests. Good luck with your studies!
